Description: FFmpeg library with de/encoders for audio/video codecs - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides a generic encoding/decoding framework and
 contains multiple decoders and encoders for audio, video and subtitle streams,
 and several bitstream filters.
 .
 The shared architecture provides various services ranging from bit stream I/O
 to DSP optimizations, and makes it suitable for implementing robust and fast
 codecs as well as for experimentation.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

 This library is a utility library to aid portable multimedia programming.
 It contains safe portable string functions, random number generators, data
 structures, additional mathematics functions, cryptography and multimedia
 related functionality (like enumerations for pixel and sample formats).
 It is not a library for code needed by both libavcodec and libavformat.
 The goal for this library is to be modular, small, efficient and useful.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
